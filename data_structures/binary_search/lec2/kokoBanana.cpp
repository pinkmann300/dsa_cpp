// Problem Statement: A monkey is given ‘n’ piles of bananas, whereas the 'ith' pile has ‘a[i]’ bananas. An integer ‘h’ is also given,
// which denotes the time (in hours) for all the bananas to be eaten.
// Each hour, the monkey chooses a non-empty pile of bananas and eats ‘k’ bananas.
// If the pile contains less than ‘k’ bananas, then the monkey consumes all the bananas and won’t eat any more bananas in that hour.
// Find the minimum number of bananas ‘k’ to eat per hour so that the monkey can eat all the bananas within ‘h’ hours.

// Super excited for this in some sense.
