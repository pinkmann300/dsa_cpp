The below is the basic notes for graphs in my Data structures and algorithms 
course. Graphs has 54 problems on takeUfoward and we will solve all of them under 
this directory. 


Lecture 1 : Types, Conventions and preliminaries. 

Difference between a directed graph and an undirected graph is that the directionality 
of an edge is specified in a directed graph and not in an undirected graph.

A graph is said to be cyclic if there exists a node such that there exists a path in the graph 
which starts from a particular vertex and ends at the same vertex.
